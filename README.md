Java Client Tools for Globalization Pipeline on IBM Bluemix
==

# What is this?

This repository contains Java tools for
[Globalization Pipeline on IBM Bluemix](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/GlobalizationPipeline/index.html).


# Getting started

To get started, you should familiarize yourself with the service itself. A good place
to begin is by reading the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-common#quick-start-guide) and the official [Getting Started with IBM Globalization ](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/GlobalizationPipeline/index.html)
documentation.

# Usage

## Command Line Interface (gp-cli)

This tool provides command line interface for accessing resource bundles and user
information. For example, exporting a resource bundle hosted by an instance
of Globalization Pipeline service to a specific file format, adding a new target
language in bundle configuration, creating a new user and so on.


## Maven Plugin (gp-maven-plugin)

This plugin integrates Globalization Pipeline service with Apache Maven build.
With the plugin, you can upload source resource bundles to your own Globalization
Pipeline service instance, and download translated resource bundles.

Please see [Globalization Pipeline Maven Plugin User Guide](gp-maven-plugin.md) for further
information.
